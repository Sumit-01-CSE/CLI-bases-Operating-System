The CLI-Based Operating System is a lightweight and modular operating system designed to run entirely through a Command Line Interface (CLI). It focuses on providing a minimal, educational, and customizable environment that demonstrates the core functionalities of an OS, including process management, memory handling, file operations, and basic system commands.

This project is built from scratch to help learners and developers understand low-level system architecture, kernel design, and command interpretation — all without the complexity of a full graphical OS.
